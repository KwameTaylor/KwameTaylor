### About me :)
Thanks for visiting my GitHub! My name is **Kwame Violet Taylor**, and I'm a 27-year-old data scientist in San Antonio via Brooklyn.

I am a Capricorn to the fullest (always reaching new heights!), parkour and gymnastics enthusiast, Hip-Hop artist, disability rights advocate, computer whiz since 1994, and a passionate devotee to the improvement of life on earth.

I dream to be an empowering force in the bountiful future we can all build together, through means of technology and compassion.

Believe it or not, data CAN be used for good!

I'm currently attending the Data Science program at <a href="https://codeup.com/ds-admissions/"><b>Codeup</b></a>. ðŸ¤“
