### About me :)
Thanks for visiting my GitHub! My name is 💫**Kwame Violet Taylor**💫, and I'm a 27-year-old **data scientist** in San Antonio via Brooklyn. 🚀

I am a Capricorn♑️ to the fullest (always reaching new heights!), parkour🏃 and gymnastics🤸 enthusiast, Hip-Hop🎧 artist, disability🦽 & LGBTQ+🌈 rights advocate, computer whiz since 1994💾, and a passionate devotee to the improvement of life on earth.🌎

I dream to be an empowering force in the bountiful future we can 🌍all🌏 build together, through means of technology and compassion. 💓

Believe it or not, data CAN be used for good!

**🧬 I'm currently attending the Data Science program at <a href="https://codeup.com/ds-admissions/"><b>Codeup</b></a>. 📚🎒**
